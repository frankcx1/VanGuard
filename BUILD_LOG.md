# VanGuard Build Log

Running log of the build. **Failures included** — that's the point.

## 2026-07-24 — M0: Plan written, repo initialized

Read the existing van documentation in `C:\vibe\Sprinter` before writing
anything, per the brief's step zero. That immediately invalidated the brief's
telemetry plan.

**The brief assumed Victron.** It specified a Cerbo GX on the van LAN, Modbus
TCP port 502, and Victron's published register list. The van has none of that —
it's an all-Renogy stack from Off Grid Adventure Vans. Brief question #1
("confirm the GX device model and LAN address") has no answer.

**Then the Renogy stack turned out to be less reachable than it first looked.**
The initial plan was to buy a Renogy Communication Hub G1 and put a USB-RS485
adapter on it to become Modbus master over the whole bus. Three findings killed
that in sequence:

1. The 300Ah battery is **Core Series**, and Core vs Smart Lithium *is* the
   comms distinction in Renogy's lineup — Core has no port and can't be
   retrofitted. The battery tells us nothing.
2. The **Shunt 300 is Bluetooth-only** — no RS485 port at any price. It can't
   join a wired bus.
3. The **inverter is CAN**, not RS485, so it can't share the DCC50S's bus.

That leaves exactly one RS485 device in the van. A hub whose purpose is
aggregating *multiple* RS485 devices onto one BT-2 is a $50 pass-through.
**Didn't buy it.** Bought a $30 BT-2 instead — and the result is better than
the wired plan: the whole telemetry layer is now one dongle plus the Surface
Pro's built-in Bluetooth. No wiring, no RJ45 pinout archaeology, no fused 12V
tap.

The sting: **SOC is only reachable over BLE**, and the Renogy ONE Core is
probably already holding that connection. Restructured the milestones to test
that first, before any model work. If it fails, this is a different project.

**Compute platform confirmed:** Surface Pro for Business 13-inch (12th Edition),
Intel Core Ultra Series 3, 50 TOPS NPU, x86-64. Briefly worried it was the
consumer Surface Pro 12-inch, which is Snapdragon/ARM and would have made
OpenVINO's NPU plugin unusable. It isn't. OpenVINO path is valid.

**Open flag:** recommended dropping Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 as primary in
favor of a modern 3–4B with native tool calling. The brief's own "model is a
config value" rule makes this cheap to change and cheap to revert.

Next: order arrives → M1 hardware handshake, in the van, on the Pro.
